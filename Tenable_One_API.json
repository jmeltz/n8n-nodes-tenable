They might require specific conditions or user interaction to be exploited.\n- **LOW**—Low-severity vulnerabilities pose a minimal risk to your organization.

This threshold can vary based on organizational risk tolerance and security policies.\n- **Example:** A user could use this filter to find all assets tagged as \"Critical Servers\" that have a weakness count greater than 50 (`HAS Tag = Critical Servers AND HAS Weakness Count > 50`). \n"},{"key":"medium_weakness_count","readable_name":"Medium Weakness Count","control":{"type":"NUMBER","multiple_allowed":false,"regex":{"hint":"number >= 0","expression":"^\\d+$"}},"operators":["=",">=",">","<=","<","exists","not exists"],"sortable":true,"filterable":true,"description":"# Medium Weakness Count \n## Number of vulnerabilities with medium severity for a specific tag.\nThis metric, available in Tenable One, represents the aggregation of vulnerabilities classified as having a \"Medium\" severity level associated with assets grouped by a specific tag.
