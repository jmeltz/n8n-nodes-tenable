Assets can include laptops, desktops, servers, routers, mobile phones, virtual machines, software containers, and cloud instances. Tenable Vulnerability Management allows you to track assets that belong to your organization, helping to eliminate potential security risks, identify under-utilized resources, and support compliance efforts.\n\nUse the API to list assets, get individual asset information, import assets, and list and check the status of asset import jobs. \n\nFor more information about asset management, see [Assets](https://docs.tenable.com/vulnerability-management/Content/Explore/Assets/ExploreAssets.htm) in the Tenable Vulnerability Management User Guide."},{"name":"Asset Attributes","description":"Assets in Tenable Vulnerability Management have a predefined set of attributes determined by plugins, connectors, etc. Asset custom attributes gives the user the ability to assign attributes beyond the predefined set. A user can set asset data known through external means such as a CMDB or other tools. These custom attributes allow the user to indicate ownership, location, risk rating, or other identifiers. For example, a user could create the `Location` custom attribute and then assign the value `US East` for a particular asset. A maximum of 10 custom attributes can be created per container. One value can be set for each custom attribute on an asset.\n\nUse the API to create, update, read, and delete custom attributes. Additionally, you can apply these custom attributes on various assets in the Container."},{"name":"Editor","description":"The editor endpoints allow you to access configuration details of Tenable Vulnerability Management policies and scans.

Workbenches provide you with an overview of actionable insights into assets and vulnerability management, which you can then use to prioritize vulnerabilities and manage assets and scan coverage in your organization's network. The workbenches API provides extended capabilities for retrieving asset and vulnerability data from the workbenches. Tenable Vulnerability Management’s new interface refers only to \"dashboards\" while offering similar feature parity to workbenches.\n\n For more information, see [Dashboards](https://docs.tenable.com/vulnerability-management/Content/Dashboards/Dashboards.htm) in the Tenable Vulnerability Management User Guide.\n\n **Note:** The Workbenches API is not intended for large or frequent exports of vulnerability and assets data. If you experience errors, reduce the volume, [rate](doc:rate-limiting), or [concurrency](doc:concurrency-limiting) of your requests or narrow your filters. Contact support if you continue to experience errors. Additionally, Tenable recommends the [POST /vulns/export](ref:exports-vulns-request-export) endpoint for large or frequent exports of vulnerability data, and the [POST /assets/v2/export](ref:export-assets-v2) endpoint for large or frequent exports of assets data.\n\n For information and best practices for retrieving vulnerability and assets data from Tenable Vulnerability Management, see:\n * [Retrieve Vulnerability Data from Vulnerability Management](doc:retrieve-vulnerability-data-from-tenableio)\n * [Retrieve Asset Data from Tenable Vulnerability Management](doc:retrieve-asset-data-from-tenableio)"}],"security":[{"cloud":[]}],"servers":[{"url":"https://cloud.tenable.com"}],"components":{"securitySchemes":{"cloud":{"type":"apiKey","in":"header","name":"X-ApiKeys","description":"Format - accessKey=ACCESS_KEY;secretKey=SECRET_KEY"}}},"x-readme":{"proxy-enabled":false,"samples-languages":["python","curl","node","powershell","ruby","javascript","objectivec","java","php","csharp","go","swift","kotlin"],"explorer-enabled":true},"paths":{"/assets":{"get":{"summary":"List assets","description":"Lists up to 5,000 assets.\n\n**Note:** You can use the [POST /assets/v2/export](ref:export-assets-v2) endpoint to export data for all assets.
